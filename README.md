# Epic.js
An open source project to build a javascript-framework (like jQuery - or Angular.js)

This project is not about making the best or most popular framework, it is about learning HOW to create a framework, and how to contribute to open source. It is intented as a place to learn for new programmers who are interested in JavaScript and learning how to contribute to open source.

This project was started by students at [Epicodus](http://epicodus.com), but is open to any interested student or jr. developer who wants to learn how to contribute to open source while practicing JavaScript.
